**REMINDER:** Problem one concerns content from [Week 1](https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/20364/modules/276455 "Week 1 - Machine Learning Introduction and Linear Regression") and [Week 2](https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/20364/modules/276456 "Week 2 - Regularised Regression").

The data in the Q1 directory in CAB420 Assessment 1A Data.zip contains socio-economic data from the 1990 US census for various US communities, and the number of violent crimes per capita (in the column ViolentCrimesPerPop). The purpose of the data is to explore the link between the various socio-economic factors and crime. The provided data has been split into training (communities train), validation (communities val), and testing (communities test) sets.

#### Using this data

You are to:

- Train a linear regression model to predict the number of violent crimes per captia from the socio-economic data.
- Train a Ridge regression model to predict the number of violent crimes per captia from the socio-economic data.
- Train a LASSO regression model to predict the number of violent crimes per captia from the socio-economic data.

For your analysis, you are to use all provided data (i.e. DO NOT perform any filtering or selection to remove columns and/or rows). For LASSO and Ridge models, the validation dataset should be used to select the optimal value of λ. All models should be evaluated on the test set. Evaluations should consider the predictive power of the model, the model complexity, and the model validity.


|     | For problem 1, your response must include sections that address the following:<br><br>- Discussion and justification of any pre-processing performed, such as standardisation.  <br>    **(suggested length, 1/3 page)**<br>- Details of the three trained models, including key parameters such as values for λ for the LASSO and Ridge models, and a brief discussion of how these were selected.  <br>    **(suggested length, 1/3 page excluding figures/tables)**<br>- An evaluation comparing the three models. Your evaluation should consider model accuracy and model validity. Discussion of accuracy/validity should also consider the socio-economic nature of this data, and if or how this impacts the the required accuracy and/or utility of the resultant models. You may also wish to discuss the relevance of terms within the model. The use of tables to summarise results, and figures to highlight details such as model validity, is strongly recommended.  <br>    **(suggested length, 1 page excluding figures/tables)**<br>- Socio-economic modelling is incredibly complex and often dealing with sensitive data and variables. Briefly discuss the ethical concerns that need to be considered when evaluating the models developed for this problem. This discussion may include reference to potential confounding variables, or to limitations in the modelling schemes used. Students are encouraged to highlight these ethical considerations and limitations to help avoid misinterpretation of the results.  <br>    **(suggested length, 1/3 page excluding figures/tables).** |
